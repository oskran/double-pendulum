# Project 1: Passed

## Exercise 1
Very good!
### Tests:
Good!
## Exercise 2
Very good! Only thing to comment is that ideally the `self.solved` attribute should be defined as a hidden attribute, i.e. by using `self._solved` instead, because this is not supposed to be accessed by the user. But this is not large issue.

### Tests:
Very good tests, but you are calling all the test functions in the code, and I'm not sure why. Simply having the `pytest.main()` call in the main block should be enough.

## Exercise 3
Very good!
### Tests:
Nice tests! Very good!

## Exercise 4
Nice animation! Very good!

## Miscellaneous
It's not really required for this exercise, but it's good practice to use labels on the axes and a title for your plots. But this is just nitpicking.

Very good docstrings as well!  
Overall very well done!
